# Java-Database-Project
This was a final project for a class of mine that I plan to continue working on. This project is my attempt to build a database and user interface in Java. In the following months I plan to upload improved versions including the version Iâ€™m currently working on. Below is a list of features I am looking to implement.

-More functions in the database to improve workflow and better match current database standards 
-Work on sorting algorithm to sort more efficiently, implement sorting by datatype (currently it only sorts by string value), and ensure it is stable (not entirely sure it is now)
-Improve the usability of the text GUI
-point and click GUI
-Import CSV files and improve reading and writing CSV files
-Add more comments so others can better understand what code is doing 
-Secure networking and multi user ability
-Secure log-on with user view permissions
-Multi-threading for reading and writing files

 *long term goal*
- Add in logging of user activity
